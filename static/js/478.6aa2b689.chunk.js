I like to build things that is fun, challenging, and useful. I like to do full stack engineer, not just backend and frontend, but also  prototyping mechanical parts, designing electrical schematics, selecting infrastructure, and choosing algorithms to use. I also have experience making full stack web applications and mobile apps. I am particularly interested in project in the area of robotics, AR/VR, and neutral network application. If you have a project you want to collab on, please hit me up.\n\n# Currently\nI am a software engineer at TikTok working on Privacy and Security. It is a brand new area that I am exploring and I feel like I am learning a lot everyday. \n\n\nOn my free time, I work on autonomous GoKarts with Berkeley students. It is very interesting to be working on a vehicle from the ground up -- from assembling it to redesign it to drive-by-wire, and then to add sensors, software stack and the whole sh-bam to it. \n\n\nI have a lot of things in mind that I want to do\n- curating my social media presence -- maybe starting a Youtube channel in all the DIY projects? \n- Starting a podcast -- encourage me to go beyond computer screen, go socialize, expand my horizon and personal network\n\n# Some history\n- I went to Dublin, Ireland for an internship abroad program, really fun, got to enjoy Europe's rich history in the silicon valley of Europe\n- I went to Japan for exchange program, have to give credit to all the japanese chef, Japanese food is the best thing!\n- I worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Material Project as an intern for three years during my undergrad, although I did not take a single lesson of chemistry at college, that is one of the most rewarding work experience\n- I am born and raised in Shanghai, China, so I do speak, read, and write fluent mandarin, and some Shanghainese\n- I have actually never toured China before, always been in the big city. When COVID ends, definitely plan on something. \n- I haven't been back to China for over 3 years\n\n# I like\n- Running\n- Badminton\n- Cycling\n- Cooking chinese food\n- Skiing\n- Cool scientific discoveries\n- Cool DIY projects\n- 3D printing stuff that I probably can get a lot cheaper and easier via Amazon :) \n- playing piano & guitar\n\n# Projects/Youtubers that I admire\n- [ROS2 Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/)\n- [Mr & Mrs Gao](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMUnInmOkrWN4gof9KlhNmQ)\n- [\u8111\u6d1e\u4e4c\u6258\u90a6](https://www.youtube.com/c/%E8%84%91%E6%B4%9E%E4%B9%8C%E6%89%98%E9%82%A6)\n- [\u5c0fLin\u8bf4](https://www.youtube.com/c/Lindsay%E8%AF%B4)\n- [\u81ea\u8bf4\u81ea\u8bdd\u7684\u603b\u88c1](https://www.youtube.com/c/%E8%87%AA%E8%AF%B4%E8%87%AA%E8%AF%9D%E7%9A%84%E6%80%BB%E8%A3%81)\n- [Joma Tech](https://www.youtube.com/c/JomaOppa)\n\n",renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
