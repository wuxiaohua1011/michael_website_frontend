# Intro

I am a engineer, builder, and DIYer. I like to build things that is fun, challenging, and useful. I like to do full stack engineer, not just backend and frontend, but also  prototyping mechanical parts, designing electrical schematics, selecting infrastructure, and choosing algorithms to use. I also have experience making full stack web applications and mobile apps. I am particularly interested in project in the area of robotics, AR/VR, and neutral network application. If you have a project you want to collab on, please hit me up.

# Currently
I am a software engineer at TikTok working on Privacy and Security. It is a brand new area that I am exploring and I feel like I am learning a lot everyday. 


On my free time, I work on autonomous GoKarts with Berkeley students. It is very interesting to be working on a vehicle from the ground up -- from assembling it to redesign it to drive-by-wire, and then to add sensors, software stack and the whole sh-bam to it. 


I have a lot of things in mind that I want to do
- curating my social media presence -- maybe starting a Youtube channel in all the DIY projects? 
- Starting a podcast -- encourage me to go beyond computer screen, go socialize, expand my horizon and personal network

# Some history
- I went to Dublin, Ireland for an internship abroad program, really fun, got to enjoy Europe's rich history in the silicon valley of Europe
- I went to Japan for exchange program, have to give credit to all the japanese chef, Japanese food is the best thing!
- I worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Material Project as an intern for three years during my undergrad, although I did not take a single lesson of chemistry at college, that is one of the most rewarding work experience
- I am born and raised in Shanghai, China, so I do speak, read, and write fluent mandarin, and some Shanghainese
- I have actually never toured China before, always been in the big city. When COVID ends, definitely plan on something. 
- I haven't been back to China for over 3 years

# I like
- Running
- Badminton
- Cycling
- Cooking chinese food
- Skiing
- Cool scientific discoveries
- Cool DIY projects
- 3D printing stuff that I probably can get a lot cheaper and easier via Amazon :) 
- playing piano & guitar
